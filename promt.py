    This version of Rasengan is also popularly known as the Demon Fox Rasengan or the Nine-Tails Rasengan because it is fueled by the Nine-Tails chakra when Naruto is in his one-tailed form.

Due to his one-tailed form, there is also no need for Naruto’s clone to come in and help him. More importantly, this Rasengan is more powerful than the basic one. This is the only other type we saw in the classic Naruto before the time skip. The upcoming versions are all that were shown after the time-skip.
